Ever wanted to have more control over the Cascading order of your stylesheets?
This new browser-wide feature makes is easier than ever.

## Explanation

The **@layer** rule in CSS is a way to organize and manage different stylesheets
into groups called "layers." Each layer is a separate unit, and you can control
the order in which they are applied to your HTML elements.

### Syntax

```css
/* statement at-rules */
@layer layer-name;
@layer layer-name, layer-name, layer-name;

/* block at-rules */
@layer {rules}
@layer layer-name {rules}
```

#### layer-name

- Is the name of the cascade layer

#### rules

- Is the set of CSS rules in the cascade layer

If you look at the CSS order, despite declaring the non-layered style first it
will still be applied after the layer styles.
